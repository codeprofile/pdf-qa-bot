        "This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot using Cohere for generative responses and Pinecone for vector storage. The bot processes a PDF document, retrieves relevant information, and allows users to query its content effectively.\n",

        "## Objectives\n",
        "- Develop a QA bot that answers questions based on a provided PDF document.\n",
        "- Utilize Pinecone as a vector database to store and retrieve document embeddings.\n",
        "- Implement Cohere as the generative model to formulate accurate answers.\n",
